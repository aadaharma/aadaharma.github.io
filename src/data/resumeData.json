        "description": "I study Information Technology at Tampere University, and am passionate about all things engineering and literature. 
        After finishing upper secondary school I took some introductory engineering courses at open university and one of them happened to be Programming 1. 
        I was immediately captivated. A second programming course solidified my decision to apply to study Information Technology. 
        My special interests include cloud engineering, testing software and game development. Gaming is one of my dearest hobbies, and learning to program them myself has been very rewarding. 
        Aside from tech, I enjoy volunteering at a children's church here in Tampere.",
